## About Voter
This is a modest voting SPA and PWA using Laravel as an API backend with no page reload on making requests to the server powered by AJAX. It offers security against multiple votes from the same visitor by logging the IP address of each user after successfully voting as a means of identification with a UI designed and created from scratch by Tailwind CSS. More features include darkmode.

Feel free to use this project as you wish, pull, edit whatever you'd like, cheers!
