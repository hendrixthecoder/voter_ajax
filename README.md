## About Voter
This is a modest voting SPA using Laravel as an API backend with no page reload on making requests to the server powered by AJAX. It offers security against multiple votes from the same visitor by logging the IP of each user as a means of identification with a UI designed and created by Tailwind CSS.

Feel free to use this project as you wish, pull, edit whatever you'd like, cheers!
